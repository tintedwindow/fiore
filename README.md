Fiore combines the ideas of journaling with minimalism, giving you an experience that reflects on your life via a visual calendar.




## Installation
Fiore is built on Flask, which is a Python web framework. If you don't already have Python, you can install it <a href="https://www.python.org/">here</a>.

Once Python is installed, download and open this repository and run the following command in your terminal to install all the dependencies:
``` bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script via this command to create the database:
``` bash
    sqlite3 schema.sql
```
Note: Running the Python script will set up the database for you, so you don't need to download SQLite separately.

### Running the app
Once finished with the installation, head over onceagain to your project directory and run it via
``` bash
    flask run
```
