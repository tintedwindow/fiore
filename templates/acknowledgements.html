                        When I started thinking of a project idea, initially I wanted to create a mini version of <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://www.geoguessr.com/" target="_blank"> Geoguessr</a> because I loved it so much (basically a game where you are placed in a random street view around the world and you have to guess where you are), and when I saw it was possible via <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://openguessr.com/" target="_blank">OpenGuessr</a>, I was eager to start my final project for CS50.
                        However, I soon realized that Geoguessr relies on <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/streetview" target="_blank">Google Street View Service</a>, and using it's API requires a Google Cloud account, which involves billing and a credit card- something I didn't have at that time.
                        This was a frustrating setback, especially since the idea of creating a mini Geoguessr had excited me so much.
                        <br>
                        It was also around the time Apple was having one of their WWDC events, and me having watched that, YouTube was recommending me older WWDC videos. And that's when I saw WWDC 2013.
                        <div style="text-align: center; margin: 5px 0px;">
                            'The first thing we ask is <a class="grey-highlight" target="_blank"> what do we want people to feel?</a>'
                        </div>
                        That line deeply resonated with me. As someone who always saw exploring street view as a means of escape, a calming feeling waiting for me in a random street of the world (especially <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="/italy" style="color: #EEBB4D ;">Italy</a>), 
                        I knew what I wanted my project to make people feel.
                        <br>
                        I also had started journaling, thanks to <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtube.com/@unjadedjade?si=5wTQWJ2Yxvby-Smi" target="_blank">Jade</a>, <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtu.be/rfeADdY1rHw?si=E9oqRKs0nkAiU1B9" target="_blank">Nathaniel</a>, <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtube.com/@malamalife?si=JbBsnp9NorT1PCfL" target="_blank">Sophie</a>, <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtu.be/JHKiDe8E4hY?si=wx-zuqzTXF0_5pUl" target="_blank">Ali</a> and <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtu.be/ZK5VUuxGYr0?si=pASTZSfYItzVb7nH" target="_blank">Sadia</a>.
                        At first, the experience was mixed since I had just started, but soon everything began to fall into place.
                        What made it easier to journal was on <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://youtu.be/JHKiDe8E4hY?si=wx-zuqzTXF0_5pUl" target="_blank">Ali's suggestion</a> to try an app called <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://dayoneapp.com/web/" target="_blank">Day One</a>, a digital journal, where on a free account, you were limited to one entry a day.
                        And this free plan limitation surprisingly ended up helping me in simplifying my journaling habits!
                        <br>
                        This limitation and the simplicity that came along with it ultimately led me to a vague idea I sketched on my <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank">Keeps</a> one night that if I could combine the feeling of looking at a place or a memory and associating it with a day, it could work.
                        And thus, the idea for Fiore was born: Framing Instances on Rectangles Everyday.
                        This project made me realize that there's so much to learn for me and it also made me realize that I infact did when I finally solved each challange whether it was flying the nett and setting up local development and making Flask work, or going from a table tag to divisions that represent days in Fiore now :)

                        I have always been a <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a> user and I've always admired it for it's simplicity and organization. I remember the first time visiting <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://www.notion.so/personal" target="_blank">their website</a> and being so inspired by it that I dreamt of making one like it. And, this project was the opportunity that aligned perfectly. I also drew inspiration from cool features on other websites, like the apology page from <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://www.wizardingworld.com/apology">Wizarding World</a> with its playful broken link reference to a misspelt teleportation spell or the <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search">Google Labs</a> page, showcasing Google's AI tools in a nice carousel. 
                        All of them came together to create a feeling reflecting the calmness of a simple and organized journal app which takes you to a Mediterranean Italian coast, Fiore.
                        <br>
                        For the projectâ€™s development, I used <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> to incorporate the <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter" target="_blank">Inter font</a> and it's variations throughout the website. <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap's icon library</a> was really handy for the icons. The project was built using <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> as my IDE. 
                        The backend language was <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Python</a>, the web framework used was <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a> with <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/patterns/sqlite3/" target="_blank">SQLite</a> to manage the database.
                    </div>
                    Here are the Python libraries that hepled me make this project possible.
                    <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 19px; line-height: 40px; margin-left: 15px;">

                        <li><a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/" target="_blank">werkzeug</a> (security and utils)</li>
                        <li><a class="acknowledgement-link" href="#" target="_blank">The Python Standard Library</a> (calendar, datetime, functools, logging, os, re, uuid)</li>
                    </ul>
                    I ran <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop/wsl" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a> in <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/" target="_blank">WSL</a> for development. Additionally, I want to thank <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" >Stack Overflow</a>, the visits to which got more and more frequent as the project expanded.
                    On roadblocks, <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://cs50.ai" target="_blank" >CS50 Duck Debugger</a> was really helpful.
                    This project also introduced me to <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">Git</a> and <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a> and Fiore's repository can be found <a class="acknowledgement-link" href="https://github.com/tintedwindow/fiore" target="_blank">here</a>.
