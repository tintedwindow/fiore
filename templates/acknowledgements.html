                    This is a CS50 project! Perhaps, the course that shaped me as a programmer, and more so a problem solver.
                    When I started this project, initially I wanted to create a mini version of Geoguessr, because I love it so much. Then when I saw it was possible via this, I was ready to start my final project for CS50.
                    But my happiness was short lived, because Geoguessr utilizes Google Street View, and to use it's API, you need a Google Cloud account, and that requires billing and hence a credit card, which I didn't have at that time.
                    I was really sad because the idea to make a mini Geoguessr came after so long.
                    It was also around the time Apple was having one of their WWDC events, and me having watched that, YouTube was recommending me old WWDC videos. And that's when I saw WWDC 2013.
                    The first thing we ask is,'what do we want people to feel?'
                    That line hit me. As someone who saw Geoguessr always as a means of escape, a calming feeling whenever I roamed around ramdom streets in the street view.
                    I knew that I wanted my project to make people experience calmness.
                    I also had started journaling, thanks to Jade, Nathaniel,Sophie, Ali and Sadia. It was a mixed experience at first, because I had just started, but quickly things started connecting.
                    What made it easier to journal was on Ali's suggestion to try an app called Day One, which kind of makes you write a journal everyday. So, on a free account, you are limited to one entry a day.
                    And that's all that inspired me for this idea.
