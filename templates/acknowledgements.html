                        When I started thinking of a project idea, initially I wanted to create a mini version of Geoguessr, because I loved it so much, and when I saw it was possible via OpenGuessr, I was ready to start my final project for CS50.
                        But my happiness was short lived, because Geoguessr utilizes Google Street View, and to use it's API, you need a Google Cloud account, and that requires billing and hence a credit card, which I didn't have at that time.
                        I was really sad because the idea to make a mini Geoguessr came after so long.
                        <br>
                        It was also around the time Apple was having one of their WWDC events, and me having watched that, YouTube was recommending me older WWDC videos. And that's when I saw WWDC 2013.
                        <br>
                        <a target="_blank" class="text-underline">The first thing we ask is</a>  <a target="_blank" class="grey-highlight">' what do we want people to feel? '</a>
                        <br>
                        That line hit me. As someone who saw exploring streets via street view always as a means of escape, a calming feeling waiting for me whenever I roamed around streets around the world and imagining living there, 
                        I knew that I wanted my project to make people feel.
                        <br>
                        I also had started journaling, thanks to Jade, Nathaniel, Sophie, Ali and Sadia. It was a mixed experience at first because I had just started, but quickly things started connecting.
                        What made it easier to journal was on Ali's suggestion to try an app called Day One, which kind of makes you write a journal everyday. So, on a free account, you are limited to one entry a day.
                        And that's all that inspired me for this idea, where you associate an entry with a day.
                        And I thought, if I could integrate the feeling of looking at a place or a memory and associating it with a day, it could work.
                        Then came the idea for Fiore! Framing instances on rectangles everyday!
                        This project made me realize that there's so much to learn for me and it also made me realize that I can infact do them when I finally solved each challange whether it was  flying the nett and setting up local development and making Flask work, or going from a table tag to divisions that represent days in Fiore now :)

                    I have always been a Notion user, and one thing that was really inspiring to me was how they kept everything so simple yet organized. I specially loved their website, and used to think that one day I would make one like this. And that's how the design of the website got finalized. It really reciprocated with the calmness of Fiore as well.
                    Coming to the libraries, and acknowledgements realted to code, Google Fonts provided the font Inter, and it's font variations are used across the website. I made this project on Visual Studio Code. 
                    The backend language was Python and the web framework used was Flask.
                    <br>
                    The Python libraries that I used for the app are:
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>cs50 (also provided SQL features)</li>
                        <li>flask</li>
                        <li>flask_sessions</li>
                        <li>werkzeug.security</li>
                        <li>werkzeug.utils</li>
                        <li>Built-in Python libraries: calendar, datetime, functools, logging, os, re, uuid</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>        
            </div>
